## Welcome to Axon System
Axon system is value based company where we believe human first, integrity within and long lasting sustainability as our vision. Inspired from Linden Lab, Monty AB and Andy Law, we share some of our core belief like them. Primarily, we focus on transparency, cost effective ICT and Business solutions for diverse range of our clients from social service sector to pure commercial entities. We believe and live by Open Business principles. Open business represents a concept of doing business in a transparent way by intimately integrating an ecosystem of participants, collaborating in public space. Open business structures make contributors and non-contributors visible such that the business benefits are distributed accordingly. They activate personal engagement and productivity by benefiting the contributors and producers that they can live from it and helping the clients to reduce their costs. Thus, we constantly work towards maximizing the benefits towards our clients and deliver the best of possible technologies. It is for the same that we have been recognized as AGENT OF CHANGE by National Business Initiative and covered by Business 360 as open business promoting entrepreneurship in Nepal.

### our services

Focused on transparent services:
The definition is inspired by open movements, open content principles, open tools and standards (free software movement, open content, free software, open source). We mainly focuses on creating “open” products and/or services. We strive to be for the benefit of all and not just for one group or stakeholders, whether shareholders, personnel, government etc. The risk of bankruptcy of such open-movement businesses is reduced because the fruits of their work remain in the commons and therefore remain as a permanent base for recovering the open business, even in their most critical situations. Since, we prefer long lasting solutions thus we work to deliver, develop and deploy variety of technologies from Free, Libre, Swatantra software stack. Some of our services ranges from generic web applications to complex ERP systems. But that does in no sense means that we do everything. We have some of specialized area of expertise to serve our clients and delight them with services that best meets their requirements.
